# website

this is the source code for my personal website, a node.js application that uses the express framework. it is hosted on a DigitalOcean app platform droplet.

## server programming

the server uses a node.js application with the [express](https://expressjs.com/) framework, and other modules which allow the code for the contact form as well as other neat little features to work. the server is hosted on a DigitalOcean app platform droplet, which is a managed server that allows me to focus on the code rather than the server itself.

## client programming

the client uses JQuery alongside vanilla JavaScript to create unique animations and effects. the website is fully responsive, using vanilla CSS and media queries to adapt to different screen sizes.

## contact form

the contact form uses the [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) module to send emails to my personal email address. 

## other neat little features

dont go to the `/coffee` path because the server is a teapot and cannot brew coffee. (this is an actual http status code lol [look](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418)).
